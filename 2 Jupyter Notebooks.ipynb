    "We'll work extensively with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/notebook.html) (formerly IPython Notebooks) in this course. They are media-rich documents that combine text with markown formatting, typeset mathematics with MathJax, and executable Python statements.\n",

    "\n",
    "Depending how you installed things, you may have a *Jupyter Notebook* shortcut directly in your Start menu (eg. Anaconda on Windows). If not, to launch the notebook server, first open up a terminal (then change into the directory where you want to store your notebooks) and then enter\n",

    "\n",

    "So what happened?  We've assigned the label x to the number 5.  And also you should see that the label of that cell will now read `In[1]:` because that's the first statement we've executed in this Python kernel.  You'll also notice that the notebook has created a new cell, since we already used the only existing cell.  \n",
